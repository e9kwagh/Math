Problem No. 21
Amicable Numbers

Let
be defined as the sum of proper divisors of (numbers less than which divide evenly into

).

If
and , where , then and are an amicable pair and each of and

are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of
are and ; therefore . The proper divisors of are , , , and ; so

.
Part A

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under

.
